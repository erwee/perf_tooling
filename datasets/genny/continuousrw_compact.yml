workload_name: continuousrw_compact
patches:
  # This patch ran the continuous reads/writes tests with periodic compaction occuring at
  # intervals of [128,256,512,1024] CRUD cycles per thread.
  # The 512 variant runs the CRUD on odd-numbered phases, unlike the others.
  # DO NOT USE the sharded results as there is a problem with contention among threads trying to
  # implicitly create the ECOC immediately after the Compaction Coordinator has renamed it.

  # This runs the sharded variant of the compaction tests after patching the compaction
  # coordinator to explicitly re-create the ECOC after renaming.
  # The intervals are still [128,256,512,1024].
