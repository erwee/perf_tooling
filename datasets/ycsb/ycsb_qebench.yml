# This workload file describes the evergreen patches and tasks that produced
# reliable data for PERF-3188 - YCSB testing of unencrypted vs FLE vs QE
workload_name: ycsb_qebench
patches:
  # This excludes the 3-node, 5-field QE test executions because they timed
  # in the final phase.
  # This excludes the unencrypted & FLE sharded test executions because
  # sharding was not actually enabled.
  # This excludes the sharded QE, 50-values, CF=default test results because
  # it was not configured correctly.
